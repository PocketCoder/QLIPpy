**Impact Measurement**

|**Introduction**|
| :- |
|<p></p><p>QLIP is Islington’s Quality, Leadership and Impact Partnership. We are a joint initiative between London Youth and Mary’s Youth Club, and we’re here to support youth organisations and youth workers to provide the best possible services to young people. </p><p></p><p>We are conducting a project to explore the **impact of youth work** on Islington’s young people, and we need your help! We want to know more about the services you provide, and the effect that your work has on young people in the borough. </p><p></p><p>This is not an evaluation of your organisation, but an opportunity for you to measure and communicate your own impact. You’ll be contributing to an exciting new report, launched this Spring, which will tell the story of Islington’s youth offer and how young people experience it. It’s also an opportunity to reflect on your own impact measurement practice and think about how to strengthen it. </p><p></p>|

**What are these tools?**

To better measure our collective impact, we have developed a new Impact Measurement Framework, which lists key outcome areas and indicators to help us understand the impact of our work. 

We have developed various tools to support youth practitioners to understand their impact on young people. You may have used other tools before, like feedback forms or surveys. These tools are designed to fit better into your existing youth provision, getting young people actively engaged in sharing the impact they have experienced. 

The tools allow you to explore different outcome areas through different methods: 

- a case study interview;
- a survey, followed by a group debrief; and 
- two creative sessions that can be conducted in a group setting.

We hope that these tools will encourage your organisation to explore and understand the impact you have had, and provide you with new evidence around what is working well and what could work even better to align with young people’s needs. 

**Important notes**

- The delivery and reporting of these sessions is completely voluntary, however, by sharing your experiences with QLIP you will contribute to the overall understanding of youth work impact in Islington, as well as help develop better and more accessible impact evaluation processes for other youth organisations.

- You are free to adapt the sessions and/or the questions suggested, as long as they relate to the same outcome area and outcomes. We are very happy to provide one-to-one guidance to help you use these tools – [click here to set up an informal chat](https://calendly.com/hayley-ly/meet) and we can support you to find ways to make the tools work for you and your delivery.
- If you have interest and capacity, you are also welcome to use and adapt the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework according to your organisation’s ways of working and existing impact evaluation processes and create your own sessions and tools.

- The QLIP Impact Measurement Framework has guidance on consent, data privacy, and ethics with regards to these data collection tools and approaches. It is recommended that you review these in detail and develop your own consent and data privacy protocols as well as ethical guidelines which you would like to use to inform any data collection processes. This should be done prior to beginning any data collection activities.

- It is possible that safeguarding concerns may be raised in the course of conducting these activities. Please make sure that whoever is conducting the activity is aware of your organisation’s safeguarding procedures and is ready to support young people who might need it.

**Tool 2 – Survey on skills and knowledge gained**

**Survey and group discussion**

The second tool combines two activities that can be done with a group of young people: a survey that can be conducted online or on paper, followed by a conversation with the group to explore some of the questions on a deeper level.

Below are the specific outcomes and indicators that this script was designed to explore:

<table><tr><th valign="top">Outcome areas</th><th valign="top">Outcomes</th><th valign="top">Indicators</th></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="6">YP have increased social, emotional and life skills and knowledge</td><td valign="top">YP gain practical and life skills</td><td valign="top">YP are able to name skills they have learned</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Improved self-awareness</td><td>YP report understanding their emotions and feelings well</td></tr>
<tr><td>YP are able to name their personal strengths</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Improved social skills</td><td>YP report improved communication skills</td></tr>
<tr><td>YP report feeling comfortable working in a group</td></tr>
<tr><td>Increased learning</td><td>YP demonstrate interest in improving current and/or learning new skills</td></tr>
</table>

If you can identify a way to include other indicators, please do so. Have a look through the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework here and adapt questions below.

**Introduction**

The survey and group debrief script provided below should help you explore what skills and knowledge have gained as a result of youth work, as well as how they perceive their personal strengths and learning. Similarly to other tools, you are free to adapt, add or skip questions both for the survey and the group discussion. 

**What you need**

**Time:** Approximately 45 minutes for the session (15 mins for the survey + 30 minutes for the discussion in the group)

**Materials:** Depending on your preferred ways of working, you may decide to conduct the survey online (e.g. young people fill out the survey using their phones or computers at your youth centre) or give out paper-based surveys. You could also ask young people to respond in a more physical way (e.g. going to certain parts of the room) but be aware that this might cause young people to respond differently as the answers are no longer private.

**Recommended process** 

**Part 1 – Preparation**

Before the session, we suggest preparing and inviting young people ahead of time: explain what the session will look like, what kind of questions will be asked, why you are interested to hear from them. Stress that participation is totally voluntary and they have the right to skip any or all questions. Finally, follow the consent processes provided by QLIP or your organisation to ensure you get informed consent from the young person.

At the start of the session, reiterate what the survey and the group discussion will be about and the rights that they have. The young people have the right to change their mind at any point and/or not answer any of the questions, if they don’t feel comfortable sharing. 

**Part 2 – Suggested survey** 

At the start of the survey, we suggest inserting a short written introduction to the activity, for example:

*“The first part of today’s session is a short survey, consisting of 10 questions. We would like to hear about the skills and knowledge you have learned at this youth centre, and what else you would like to learn in the future. You can choose to skip any questions that you don’t want to answer. Following this survey, we will also have a conversation as a group. Thank you for agreeing to share your experiences with us!”*

1. How long have you been attending this youth centre? 
   1. Less than 6 months
   1. 6 months – 1 year
   1. 1 – 3 years
   1. More than 3 years

1. Since joining, have you learned any of the following skills at this youth centre?
   Note: the answer options here should be adapted based on the priorities of your organisation – ask about the specific skills you want to see young people develop.
   1. Teamwork skills
   1. Conflict management skills
   1. Stress management skills
   1. Creativity
   1. Budgeting skills
   1. Healthy eating 
   1. Other (please specify): 


2\.1. Can you tell us more about how you learnt these skills?

Now, we would also like to learn more about some of your social and emotional skills:

1. Do you feel your communication skills have improved as a result of attending your youth club?
   1. Yes
   1. No
   1. Don’t know

3\.1 Can you tell us more about why you chose this answer?

1. How well do you feel you understand other people’s emotions and feelings? 

   Rate from 1 to 10.

   4\.1 Can you tell us more about why you chose this answer?

1. How well do you feel you understand your own emotions and feelings? 

   Rate from 1 to 10.

   5\.1 Can you tell us more about why you chose this answer?

1. Is there anything at the moment that you would like to learn, for example, new skills or knowledge areas?
1. Yes
1. No
1. Don’t know

6\.1 If yes, what would it be? Where could you learn it?

**Part 3 – Group discussion**

After young people have completed the survey, we suggest coming back to the group and leading a more open discussion on learning both in and beyond the youth centre. Before starting the conversation, we also would advise asking young people if they had any questions while completing the survey and what did they think about the survey overall.

Some of the other questions for the group discussion could include the below. However, we encourage you to adapt them based on your organisation’s model and priorities.

1. In general, do you like to learn new skills or about new things? Why or why not? 
1. What are your favourite ways to learn in the youth centre? 
1. Do you think youth centres are a good place to learn additional skills and knowledge? Why or why not?
1. What other skills and knowledge (beyond those you mentioned in the survey) do you think you gained since joining the youth centre? What helped you learn them? 
1. Do you feel your communication skills (communicating with others) have improved as a result of attending the youth centre? If yes, can you share an example?
1. Do you feel you understand yourself (your thoughts, feelings, behaviour, likes and dislikes) better as a result of attending the youth centre? If yes, what helped you most to develop this skill? 
1. How do you feel participating in group activities at the youth centre? Do you now feel more confident than when you first joined or not? Why do you think that might be? 
1. What are some other things you would like to learn? Could they be learned in the youth centre?
