The Quality, Leadership and Impact Partnership (QLIP) is an initiative led by London Youth with Mary’s Youth Club, commissioned by Islington Council, to provide wrap-around support to youth organisations and practitioners in the borough. We champion high-quality youth work, strengthen youth workers and organisations, and measure and communicate the sector’s impact.

Young Islington is the borough’s vision for a new universal youth offer. It aims to provide locally-led, inter-connected youth work across the borough that meets the needs of diverse young people, rooted in sustainable networks of youth and community services. London Youth and Mary’s provide a central leadership function that will support high-quality youth work, strengthen youth workers and organisations, and measure and communicate impact. We do this creatively and collaboratively, quickly responding to emerging needs and trends. It’s a journey, so we’re always seeking feedback from a wide range of stakeholders to ensure that we can adapt and adjust our support to make it as effective as possible.
