Supervision is a collaborative process with professional boundaries involving the exploration and sharing of practice. The process is mindful of the expectation of a duty of care and the need for ethical, effective, efficient, and so safe delivery of services.

Supervision is a means of reflection and an organic form of quality assurance, holding in mind the benefit, safeguarding and well-being of practitioners, clients and the organisation.
