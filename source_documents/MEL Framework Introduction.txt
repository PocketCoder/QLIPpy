okay welcome to this short video where I'm going to talk you through how to use the clip um impact measurement framework for Islington youth ORS um we know this document can look a little overwhelming particularly if you're not really familiar um with youngest Link's theory of change or with male Frameworks so this is a short video to talk you through how to use this and hopefully make it feel a little simpler um my name is Ruth Virgo I work at London youth as the youth sector development manager and you can see in this top corner here um my email address so if you've got any questions or you want some support do feel free to reach out so we're starting um with this tab called overview and I'm not going to spend loads of time here um but this is giving you an overview of what each of the tabs are so you'll see um there's some guidance in tab a about how to use the framework there's the full monitoring evaluation and learning framework which is what Mal stands for um and this is essentially a tool to help filter through and help you decide what what um what tools you're going to use to collect data so to collect stories from young people um that you work with and then tabs C to J are all different guidance so C to G is guidance on specific types of data collection tools that you might use and we have templates for these on the clip website as well that are available to download tab H is guidance on how you might Implement some of the learning you gain from from doing this activities tab I is on consent and tab J is on the ethics of research and this is quite useful background information so this framework looks at what is the impact of youth work and we're looking at short-term um outcomes as well as like the longer term outcomes that we understand because we want to demonstrate in real time the difference that youth work is making and youth spaces are making to young people in a way that helps tell the story to parents and carers helps young people reflect on their experiences and ultimately helps with reporting and fundraising explaining why the work that you do is so so valuable so um we worked a lot with different stakeholders throughout Islington um to develop this um including lots of Youth practitioners and young people who were who were involved in the process and with the um London B of isington team as well um and the social investment consultancy are our male evaluation partner on the clip project so they have developed this framework for you to use um we use this framework for the annual impact report where we showcase the story of Youth Work across the burough um but it's also just a really helpful male framework and it should align with some of your organizations um like outcomes and various activities already and we've got four outcomes that we're looking at and these are physical and emotional well-being so this is things like young people having improve physical health improved emotional well-being an improved sense of safety improved resilience social emotional and life skills and knowledge so young people have improved practical and life skills young people are developing their social skills improving their self-awareness and increasing their opportunities to learn in different ways um sense of agency and motivation you know young people have increased sense of ownership over the project and the provision um increased confidence and improved aspirations and Ambitions for the future for their own growth but also for what their life might look like in you know six months a year three years five years whatever is appropriate and finally connections with networks of support and communities so this is improved connections with others improved connections with communities that they're a part of and this could be things such as the lgbtq plus Community it could be an ethnographic Community for example um a young person with Somali Heritage might have improved connection with Somali culture and Heritage in the community there and improved access to services so this is things like um support from the local Authority such as social care um education providers whether um mainstream school or a people referral unit um emotional well-being services such as counseling hams therapeutic services the GP um any sort of service that young people have a right to access and should be able to access so I'm going to spend a little bit of time look just looking quickly at tabs A and B um to give you a quick overview so tab a is guidance for how to use this this framework um and essentially the first first step is to have a look at four outcomes and decide which areas of impact line up with what you're doing what activities you're already doing that you think um demonstrate this what are the potential short medium long-term outcomes of these activities and what is the most important for you to be measuring at the moment in your provision is there specific activities that funders one specific information on for example then once you've done that and you've done that piece of thinking recommend you look through the whole male framework and think about what activities or like opportunities do you have to collect some data and this can be done in a range of different ways for example case studies interviews surveys group discussions creative activities observations um are the ones that we've got guidance on but there are other ways of collect qualitative data and qualitative is all about the story it's about the quality of the data um so yeah what where can you collect data in your data tap provision what indicators are going to best showcase your organization the eforce the story you want to tell and then it's time to pick for tools and some of this will be done by picking the indicators because some indicators lends being measured in a specific way some of this will be about what you think is going to be most interesting and exciting for the team but also for the young people you might even have young people who want to be part of collecting the data as well as contributing to it which is great practice and good skills for them if they want to do any sort of evaluation work in the future so on to the actual framework and this I know can look like a lot a lot of tabs so I'm just going to go through outcome area one and demonstrate how you might want to use um this so starting here outcome one young people have better physical and emotional well-being how are we going to know that that is occurring and this framework document we go from the left of the page to the right of the page like you're reading a book so how do we know that they have better physical emotional wellbeing well they would have they would demonstrate improved physical health what does that look like exactly so if we just stick with this indicator and go to the right it might look like young people reporting that they enjoy taking part in physical activity ities Sports young people reporting that they're doing more physical activity than they maybe were before joining the youth the youth club or the youth program it could be number of young people taking part in sports activities at the Youth Organization in the last 6 9 12 months young people reporting an increase in healthy eating habits and young people are able to name healthy eating habits that they have started this is also relates a little bit to self-awareness um in outcome free and this is how the whole thing is laid out so the outcome specific indicators and then the micro indicators what that actually looks like in practice so if we continue and you can see that in the headings um if we continue traveling to the right what we've now got is a matrix in tabs D to H that indicates what kind of data collection tool might be most useful to find out if this is true so for example with um young people report that they enjoy taking part in physical activities sport that might be in a case study or an interview it's something you might be able to get from a survey you might have a group discussion about a specific Sports activity that you've been doing like football club or something like that where young people speak about this so and then you'll see in tab I source of information here is YP and that is young person so we're looking at case study survey or discussion mostly for this although you might be able to come up with a creative um a creative method that Capt this information you'll see that it's not really um an indicator it lends itself to Observation because young people have to report that they enjoy this they have to tell you um and then here we have some example questions how much do you enjoy physical activities Sports and you can make that more specific obviously what's your favorite physical or sport activity and this is an open question so you're asking you're interested a young person might say they hate it they might say they don't really know and you have a bit more of a discussion it's an open question um and there's some examples of answers that might be indicative of aligning with or not aligning with this indicator and there's some potential follow-up questions that you might want to ask um it's this sort of question it's only really relevant for if your organization is doing physical activities or Sports in some kind with young people um because if you're not you might have had a discussion about young people taking up more activities and then young people do that but this would be more relevant to the next indicator 1.1b um hopefully that is all nice and clear another potential question how much you enjoy physical activity sport rate from 1 to 10 and this is what is kind of useful more in a survey or a group discussion context you can see it's on the same column and that's a 1 to 10 scale indicative of whether the the indicator is true so young people do enjoy physical activities in sport would be a seven or above anything less than that is not really demonstrating that they they enjoy it and then again the follow-up questions are the same and that's why it's a little bit chunky here and so that's how to use this framework is to look at the outcomes and you're probably measuring all the out you're probably delivering all the outcomes realistically with a youth provision um but you might not be delivering all the indicators within that um or it might not be appropriate to try and collect that that data um but but you've got the actual specifics of what this might look like the Matrix of what kind of data collection tool might be useful this is the sort of question you would ask what kind of question is it you know open one to 10 yes no potential follow like potential follow-ups what the examples are of how this works and any sort of comments or notes um for example you know some conversations are initiated by young person or youth worker um some are only worth like some are only applicable if you're doing specific work or you have been doing specific work on this topic otherwise you can't really say that the youth club played a role in um causing this this behavior um so hopefully that is really clear um if you have any questions as I said my email is at the top of the framework here do feel free to get in touch um and the clct team are also really happy to have a chat with you about what kind of data collection methods might work really well your organization um how the outcomes overlap do a bit of a bit of that thinking together um I hope that has been helpful thank you very much
