Title: Youth Work in Islington: Impact Report 2022/23 – QLIP

We are excited to share the first impact report on youth work in Islington!

This report, published by Islington’s Quality and Impact Steering Group and produced by the Quality, Leadership and Impact Partnership (QLIP), brings together data and evidence from providers across the borough to demonstrate the crucial impact of the Young Islington universal youth work offer. It paints a picture of how Islington’s youth sector is meeting the needs of the borough’s young people and supporting them to develop and grow.

This first report spotlights themes including diversity and inclusion, physical and emotional wellbeing, life skills and knowledge, sense of agency and motivation, and connections to networks of support and communities. As part of this report, young people shared their own stories and experiences through youth-led interviews. Throughout the report there are opportunities to hear from them in their own words.

If you’re interested to learn more about impact measurement, or even be showcased in next year’s report, QLIP can help!
