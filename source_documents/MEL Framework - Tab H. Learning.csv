,,"As part of using this MEL framework to understand your impact, we also suggest embedding regular learning and reflection spaces within your organisations. These spaces can be designed according to the ways of working with your team, and it is up to you and your team how they will be delivered and who will lead them. We suggest deciding on the length of these learning cycles in advance and holding space for them every 6, 9 or 12 months (or another timeline that makes sense for your organisation; in this example, we use 6 months)."
,,"Prior to the learning and reflection session, the team should collate all impact data collected in the last 6 months and bring it to the meeting so it can be discussed as a group. "
,,
,,We suggest a following structure for these sessions (which can be adapted to your team's needs and ways of working):
,,Part 1 (Impact)
,1.1,Reviewing the impact on young people in the last 6 months: team member(s) share the data they have collected based on the agreed outcomes and discuss whether the data reflects their personal views of the young people. Is there anything that 'doesn't sound right?' Is there any impact areas that have been observed but are not reflected in the data presented?
,1.2,Identifying and discussing areas of impact that could be strengthened in the next 6 months. What specific steps can the team take to ensure we achieve what we want to achieve? What barriers do we face currently and can we address those? Do we need any external support or expertise?
,1.3,Discussing data collection processes within the organisation. Have the young people been willing to open up about themselves? Does the team see value in understanding the impact better? Which data collection tools did not work or worked particularly well? What other challenges around data collection do we face currently and how can we address those?
,,Part 2 (General)
,2.1,What are some of the key lessons for the individual youth workers and organisation as a whole from the last six months?
,2.2,How can we embed these learnings into our practice in the next six months?
,2.3,"Where do we still have gaps, questions and concerns regarding our work? What do we want to achieve in the next six months?"
,2.4,To what extent are we connecting and collaborating with other YOs? How have (or can) these partnerships improve our offer to YP?
,2.5,To what extent are young people influencing our activities and work in the organisation? How can we ensure they feel ownership over youth work?
,,
,,"Following these sessions, we suggest writing a summary of the Part 1 of the conversation that can be shared with QLIP. This will help us understand what impact is achieved throughout Islington across youth organisations, what are the most common challenges and how can QLIP best support youth organisations. It will also help us continuously revise and reflect on the MEL framework and suggested data collection processes."
