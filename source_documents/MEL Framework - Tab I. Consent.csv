,Informed Consent*
,"QLIP feels it is crucial that young people consent to any data collection in an informed, voluntary and ethical way. Below is some suggestions for ways to do this but we encourage all organisations to do their own research and develop their own consent processes. "
,
,"When you ask for permission for children to be involved in any data collection activities, ensure that children and their parents or carers (if needed) fully understand:"
,- what the activity is about
,- how the data will be recorded (e.g. video recordings etc)
,- how the data will be stored (e.g. in a password protected excel or on a CRM) and shared (e.g. via a secure server or over email)
,- what the data will and wont be used for
,- what is expected of participants
,- what the risks and benefits of participating in the activity are
,- that participating is voluntary.
,This is known as informed consent.
,
,"Within this it is important to discuss who the data will be shared with. This should be both who within the organisation will have access to the data (e.g. just the youth work team or the whole organisation), what data they will be able to see (e.g. identifiable, anonymised or analysed data) and those external to the organisation. This will include discussing that the data in an anonymised format will be shared with QLIP and the process by which it will be shared. Please see Tab L for more information on this."
,
,Make sure you consider children’s capacity to consent to involvement in the activity. This will depend on their level of understanding of the potential risks and benefits of taking part.
,
,"When considering whether a child is mature enough to make decisions about things that directly affect them, professionals often talk about whether the child is ‘Gillick competent’. Gillick competency means a young person is mature enough to fully understand what they are agreeing to."

,"If a child isn’t fully able to understand the consequences of taking part, but is able to express willingness to participate and understand what is expected of them, it may be appropriate to seek their ‘assent’. In such cases consent should always be sought from their parent or carer."
,
,"Consent should also be obtained from the parent, carer or other appropriate adult for all children under the age of 8, and in most cases for children aged 8-15. For young people aged 16 and 17, you should carefully consider whether parental consent is appropriate. If you don’t seek parental consent, you should justify your approach and consider whether parents should be informed of the activity."
,
,"If a child doesn’t consent or assent to participate in data collection activity, this overrides the consent from the parent, guardian, carer, or other appropriate adult with a duty of care."
,
,It must be made clear that there are no negative consequences to refusing to take part in the activity and that children or their parent or carer can also withdraw consent at any time. You should regularly check with young people and their families during the process that they are still happy to take part.
,
,You should have a formal record that consent has been given before the activity starts. Using a consent form enables children to confirm they understand what the activity will involve and are happy to take part. You should include all of the above information in the consent form and make sure the young people have a copy of this for themselves. It should also include a summary of the data privacy policy (see below) and clear instructions where they can access more information on this.
,
,You should keep all participants’ personal information confidential and comply with the Data Protection Act 2018. 
,
,It is crucial you have a data privacy statement that all those you are collecting evidence from have a chance to read. This will explain how the data will be stored and who it will be shared with. This is an example from Mary’s Youth Services.
