,How to use this framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,1.        Using the Theory of Change in the Overview tab review and discuss all of the outcomes with your team. Select the ones that you think apply most appropriately to your work. You will need to discuss:,,,,,,,,,,,"2. Once you have shortlisted the relevant outcomes for your work, using the MEL Framework in Tab B, select the most relevant indicators to your work. There are multiple indicators for each outcome and not all will be relevant to your work. In this conversation you should consider:",,,,,,,,,,,,"3. The final stage is to look at the data collection tools. Each indicator has its corresponding data collection approaches, including sources, tools, questions, and answer types (B. MEL Framework tab). There are five different types of data collection approaches for each indicator: case study interview, survey, group discussion, creative and observation. When selecting the data collection approaches it is important to consider:",
,•   What areas of impact you will be working in,,,,,,,,,,,•   What you think is possible for you to collect data on,,,,,,,,,,,,•   How these tools will fit with the existing practices and processes within your organisation,
,•   What activities you will be doing within each of these areas,,,,,,,,,,,•   Which indicators fit best with the ethos of your organisation,,,,,,,,,,,,•   How the young people you work with will respond to the different tools,
,"•   What are the potential short, medium and long term outcomes of these activities",,,,,,,,,,,•   Which indicators are best for the story you want to tell as an organisation,,,,,,,,,,,,•   The capacity of staff to deliver these data collection tools including their skills but also time they have available,
,•   Which outcomes are the most important for you to measure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The framework has been designed for you to be able to use filters to be able to create your own bespoke MEL framework so please do filter the framework as you work through these steps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Next steps and suggestions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Important: while the data collection tools suggested for each indicator are recommended, we advise you to consider the following when adapting the framework:"
,"The framework provides advice on the questions and frequency of data collection so using the framework and the outcomes, indicators and data collection tools selected, you can extract the relevant questions to create your bespoke tools e.g. paste each of the group discussion questions you have selected into a group discussion guide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,?,"Is this question better asked in a group or an individual setting? (e.g., will young people feel comfortable sharing this information with their peers?)"
,You may need to review the order of questions once you have created your data collection tool to ensure there is a flow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,You should also include the relevant introduction and consent protocols to the tools before you start using them. If you would like any support on what to include here please do let us know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,?,"Does the answer to the question potentially require a follow-up from the youth workers? (e.g., questions on emotional wellbeing, sense of safety) These questions should not be included in an anonymous survey"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Depending on which tool you are choosing to use and the frequency of data collection you will need to consider the following:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•   Do you need a baseline?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,?,"Can the question be easily understood and answered (e.g. yes/no questions, short answers) or does it require a deeper conversation? "
,•   When and how will you collect the data?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•   How will you store the data?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There also might be additional considerations for the specific youth groups that your organisation is working with, e.g. different age groups might require different phrasing, however, we trust your expertise and judgement on how to best speak to the young people you work with! Moving forwards, this framework will be developed further and new considerations might be added as we learn collectively from this process. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Monitoring and evaluation is not just about accountability but also an opportunity to learn for the organisation, seeking opportunities to maximise impact. As such we have included a structure to support this process in your organisation in Tab H. Learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
