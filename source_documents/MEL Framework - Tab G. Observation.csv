,Introduction
,"Finally, for certain outcomes, youth workers can also keep a log over a period of time (e.g. 6 months) to track certain indicators that can be reviewed once in a while. For this method, it is important to decide on the indicators in advance, as it might be more difficult to get accurate data retroactively. Observation is useful as an additional data point, particularly to compare data collected directly from young people vs. what the youth workers have observed or learned about over a period of time. If observation is applied over a few learning 'cycles' (e.g. 2 years), then it will also help observe any changes or tendencies that need addressing."

,Examples
,"1. If the youth club already monitors young people's attendance in various activities, some of the indicators can easily be tracked without additional effort from the youth workers. These indicators include 1.1c 'Number of YP taking part in sport activities in YO in the last 6/9/12 months', 2.1b 'Number of YP attending skill-based workshops or activities within YO in the last 6/9/12 months', 4.3a 'Number of signposting/referral cases to other services in the community in the last 6/9/12 months', and potentially others depending on the youth club's practices. "
,"2. Some of the suggested indicators might require additional tracking, as to understand the impact, it is also useful to note more informal interactions between young people and the youth club or the youth workers. These indicators include 1.2b 'Number of 1:1 conversations with YP around their well-being in the last 6/9/12 months', 3.1b 'Number of YP who take responsibilities within the youth club over the last 6/9/12 months' or 3.3b 'Number of YP who took up new opportunities in the last 6/9/12months'. "
,"3. There are also some indicators that are based on youth workers' subjective perception and are more qualitative methods of observation, requiring youth workers to note some examples or specific cases of young people achieving this outcome. For example, 3.2d 'Percentage of YP who speak up and share their opinions in a group' or 4.1h 'YP are able to solve conflicts within YO (with or without YW help)'."
,
,"Additionally, all data collected (with any data collection tool) should always be critically reviewed by youth workers, as they often have the best insight whether young people are sharing their experiences openly and honestly, or are they experiencing any barriers that might influence their answers (e.g., wanting to please the youth workers or feeling peer pressure)."
