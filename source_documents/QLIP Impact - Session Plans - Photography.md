**Impact Measurement**

|**Introduction**|
| :- |
|<p></p><p>QLIP is Islington’s Quality, Leadership and Impact Partnership. We are a joint initiative between London Youth and Mary’s Youth Club, and we’re here to support youth organisations and youth workers to provide the best possible services to young people. </p><p></p><p>We are conducting a project to explore the **impact of youth work** on Islington’s young people, and we need your help! We want to know more about the services you provide, and the effect that your work has on young people in the borough. </p><p></p><p>This is not an evaluation of your organisation, but an opportunity for you to measure and communicate your own impact. You’ll be contributing to an exciting new report, launched this Spring, which will tell the story of Islington’s youth offer and how young people experience it. It’s also an opportunity to reflect on your own impact measurement practice and think about how to strengthen it. </p><p></p>|

**What are these tools?**

To better measure our collective impact, we have developed a new Impact Measurement Framework, which lists key outcome areas and indicators to help us understand the impact of our work. 

We have developed various tools to support youth practitioners to understand their impact on young people. You may have used other tools before, like feedback forms or surveys. These tools are designed to fit better into your existing youth provision, getting young people actively engaged in sharing the impact they have experienced. 

The tools allow you to explore different outcome areas through different methods: 

- a case study interview;
- a survey, followed by a group debrief; and 
- two creative sessions that can be conducted in a group setting.

We hope that these tools will encourage your organisation to explore and understand the impact you have had, and provide you with new evidence around what is working well and what could work even better to align with young people’s needs. 

**Important notes**

- The delivery and reporting of these sessions is completely voluntary, however, by sharing your experiences with QLIP you will contribute to the overall understanding of youth work impact in Islington, as well as help develop better and more accessible impact evaluation processes for other youth organisations.

- You are free to adapt the sessions and/or the questions suggested, as long as they relate to the same outcome area and outcomes. We are very happy to provide one-to-one guidance to help you use these tools – [click here to set up an informal chat](https://calendly.com/hayley-ly/meet) and we can support you to find ways to make the tools work for you and your delivery.
- If you have interest and capacity, you are also welcome to use and adapt the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework according to your organisation’s ways of working and existing impact evaluation processes and create your own sessions and tools.

- The QLIP Impact Measurement Framework has guidance on consent, data privacy, and ethics with regards to these data collection tools and approaches. It is recommended that you review these in detail and develop your own consent and data privacy protocols as well as ethical guidelines which you would like to use to inform any data collection processes. This should be done prior to beginning any data collection activities.

- It is possible that safeguarding concerns may be raised in the course of conducting these activities. Please make sure that whoever is conducting the activity is aware of your organisation’s safeguarding procedures and is ready to support young people who might need it.

**Tool 3 – Session on the sense of agency and motivation**

**Using photography**

The third tool in this toolkit adopts a creative evaluation method – photovoice – to encourage young people to explore their sense of agency within and beyond the youth organisation, their confidence in themselves and their goals. We also suggest how to facilitate the conversation following the creative activity in a group setting.

Below are the specific outcomes and indicators that this session was designed to explore:

<table><tr><th valign="top">Outcome areas</th><th valign="top">Outcomes</th><th valign="top">Indicators</th></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="6">YP have a higher sense of agency and motivation</td><td valign="top">Sense of ownership within youth work</td><td valign="top">YP report they feel involved in shaping youth work</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="3">Increased confidence</td><td>YP report feeling able to achieve their goals</td></tr>
<tr><td>YP report an increase in confidence</td></tr>
<tr><td>YP are able to name something they are proud of</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Improved aspirations and ambitions</td><td>YP report willingness to try new things</td></tr>
<tr><td>YP report having tried new things in the last 6/9/12 months and are able to name specific examples</td></tr>
</table>

If you can identify a way to include other indicators, please do so. Have a look through the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework here and adapt questions below.

**Introduction**

The photo-based activity and the group debrief script provided below should help you explore how young people see themselves within the youth organisations, their overall levels of confidence and aspirations and ambitions. Similarly to other tools, you are free to adapt the activity and the group discussion. 

**What you need**

**Time:** You have several different options to deliver this session:

- You can give young people a distinct period of time (for example, one hour) to take photographs based on the prompts provided, followed by a group discussion on the same day
- Alternatively, you can ask young people to take photographs over a longer period (e.g., one week) and come back to discuss them as a group on an agreed day

**Materials:** To allow all young people to take photographs, you should consider whether they have and are able to use their phones as cameras. If some young people do not have personal phones or are unable to use them for this purpose, you might want to consider allowing to use phones belonging to the youth centre (under supervision and in line with your e-safety or tech policies); young people can also complete the exercise in pairs sharing one phone (with the consent of those whose phones are being used). 

As another alternative, you may decide to deliver this session using drawings/paintings or another type of creative medium instead of photographs.

**Recommended process** 

**Part 1 – Preparation**

At the start of the session, you should inform the young people about the purpose of the activity. You should inform the young people in advance that the session will consist of (1) them taking photographs based on different prompts and (2) sharing their photographs with the peer group and discussing them. They also should be aware that if they do not feel comfortable sharing their photographs with others, they will not have to do that. Stress that participation is totally voluntary and they have the right to skip any or all questions. Finally, follow the consent processes provided by QLIP or your organisation to ensure you get informed consent from the young person.

**Part 2 – Photo activity**

For the photo activity, invite young people to take three photographs based on these prompts:

1) My experience at this youth centre
1) Something I am proud of
1) My future goal, ambition or dream

After providing them with the prompts, invite them to ask questions and clarify the prompts if they feel they are not clear enough. Where possible, leave room for their own interpretation (especially if you are working with older groups of children and young people), however, if they are struggling with the task, provide them with a space to discuss ideas for their photographs before actually taking them. 

**Part 3 – Discussion in a group**

For the second part of this session, we suggest bringing the group of young people back together to share their pictures with each other and discuss what has been photographed (ideally, you would be able to show the pictures taken on a projector so everybody can see them at the same time, however, that is not essential). As an additional suggestion, you can invite young people to think of captions for their three pictures.

Although there are different ways to facilitate the group conversation and based on each group different methods might work best, we suggest this structure:

1. For each of the pictures taken, show the picture to the group so everybody can take a look. It might be best to go through the pictures by themes (e.g., looking at everyone’s ‘experience at the youth centre’, followed by ‘something I am proud of’, etc.); you may also ask young people to select one picture each they want to show to the group (particularly if the group is more than 4-5 people).
1. Ask the group: What do you think is pictured here? What does this picture make you feel? What questions do you have for the author of this picture? You can be flexible in how to lead this question, however, allow the young people to associate freely. Ensure young people are respectful of each other’s photographs and opinions.
1. Ask the author: How do you feel listening to the group? What was your original idea for this picture? 

The initial discussion about the pictures should encourage young people to think and reflect about theirs and their peers’ experiences at the youth centre, their confidence in themselves and their future goals. For each of the themes explored, we also suggest additional general follow-up questions that can be posed to the group:

1) My experience at this youth centre
   1. What has been your favourite memory in this youth centre?
   1. What could make your experience here better? 
   1. Do you feel that youth workers listen to young people’s opinions here? Why or why not?
   1. Do you feel like you are involved in shaping the centre’s activities and day-to-day life? Why or why not? 
1) Something I am proud of
   1. What or who helped you achieve this and how?
   1. How confident do you feel in yourself? What helps you feel more confident?
   1. How do you feel about trying new things (for example, new activities offered at your youth club)? What helps you to try new things?
   1. Have you tried any new things (for example, new activities offered at your youth club, new hobbies or learning opportunities) in the last year? If so, what were they?
1) My future goal, ambition or dream
   1. What are some other goals that you have (short- or long-term)? 
   1. Are you working towards them, and if so, how? Do you feel you will be successful in achieving them?

As with other activities, the facilitator should be recording the answers and making notes, particularly about young people’s reflections of how the youth centre and youth workers contributed to their confidence, sense of ownership and goal setting.
