October’s hybrid training workshop Coffee with QLIP recently gathered youth workers for an insightful session focused on ADHD. With expert contributions from Abby Anjorin (SEMH/Intake Senior Clinician) and Nicole Julien-Connage (Psychotherapist & Mental Health Speaker), participants engaged in lively discussions about ADHD and how best to support neurodivergent young people.

The workshop stood out for its inclusion of multiple perspectives, offering insights from young people, parents, guardians, and professionals. A central theme was the sharing of personal experiences with ADHD, creating an empathetic space for attendees to reflect on the diverse challenges faced by young people. Best practices were discussed, including how to better communicate and create inclusive environments in youth work provisions.

A key highlight was the introduction of a unique game tool designed by QLIP to facilitate conversations about ADHD signs and symptoms between youth workers and young people. This tool provided an interactive way to approach a sometimes difficult topic, making it easier to spark meaningful dialogue. If you use the card game for training or with young people, let us know what you think.

This Coffee with QLIP session blended theory with practice, offering youth workers practical tools and a deeper understanding of ADHD in a collaborative and engaging environment. If you missed this session you can catch up with our online presentation.
