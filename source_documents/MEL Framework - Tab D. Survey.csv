,Delivering a survey
,In order to design and deliver a survey you should consider the following steps:
,"1.        Once you have designed the survey using the questions in your framework, decide who you will be issuing the survey too. This may depend on the age groups or when the young people started attending the centre or a specific demographic group you have identified as wanting more information on. Depending on whether you will be conducting these surveys as baseline, midline or endline it may be important to consider what additional information you might need as part of this."
,"2.        Decide how you will issue the survey e.g. emailing to young people, asking them to fill in when they arrive at the centre or issuing paper copies as part of an activity. This will dictate what tech you will need, what format you need to have the survey in and how long the data collection period will be. There are a lot of free survey softwares you can use including Google Forms and Survey Monkey."
,3.        Once you have issued the survey and collected all the data you will need to collate all the responses and conduct data analysis. This will help you identify trends and anomalies within the data and build a better picture of where the young people you are working with are.
