**Impact Measurement**

|**Introduction**|
| :- |
|<p></p><p>QLIP is Islington’s Quality, Leadership and Impact Partnership. We are a joint initiative between London Youth and Mary’s Youth Club, and we’re here to support youth organisations and youth workers to provide the best possible services to young people. </p><p></p><p>We are conducting a project to explore the **impact of youth work** on Islington’s young people, and we need your help! We want to know more about the services you provide, and the effect that your work has on young people in the borough. </p><p></p><p>This is not an evaluation of your organisation, but an opportunity for you to measure and communicate your own impact. You’ll be contributing to an exciting new report, launched this Spring, which will tell the story of Islington’s youth offer and how young people experience it. It’s also an opportunity to reflect on your own impact measurement practice and think about how to strengthen it. </p><p></p>|

**What are these tools?**

To better measure our collective impact, we have developed a new Impact Measurement Framework, which lists key outcome areas and indicators to help us understand the impact of our work. 

We have developed various tools to support youth practitioners to understand their impact on young people. You may have used other tools before, like feedback forms or surveys. These tools are designed to fit better into your existing youth provision, getting young people actively engaged in sharing the impact they have experienced. 

The tools allow you to explore different outcome areas through different methods: 

- a case study interview;
- a survey, followed by a group debrief; and 
- two creative sessions that can be conducted in a group setting.

We hope that these tools will encourage your organisation to explore and understand the impact you have had, and provide you with new evidence around what is working well and what could work even better to align with young people’s needs. 

**Important notes**

- The delivery and reporting of these sessions is completely voluntary, however, by sharing your experiences with QLIP you will contribute to the overall understanding of youth work impact in Islington, as well as help develop better and more accessible impact evaluation processes for other youth organisations.

- You are free to adapt the sessions and/or the questions suggested, as long as they relate to the same outcome area and outcomes. We are very happy to provide one-to-one guidance to help you use these tools – [click here to set up an informal chat](https://calendly.com/hayley-ly/meet) and we can support you to find ways to make the tools work for you and your delivery.
- If you have interest and capacity, you are also welcome to use and adapt the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework according to your organisation’s ways of working and existing impact evaluation processes and create your own sessions and tools.

- The QLIP Impact Measurement Framework has guidance on consent, data privacy, and ethics with regards to these data collection tools and approaches. It is recommended that you review these in detail and develop your own consent and data privacy protocols as well as ethical guidelines which you would like to use to inform any data collection processes. This should be done prior to beginning any data collection activities.

- It is possible that safeguarding concerns may be raised in the course of conducting these activities. Please make sure that whoever is conducting the activity is aware of your organisation’s safeguarding procedures and is ready to support young people who might need it.

**Tool 1 – Understanding individual journeys**

**Case study interview (1:1)**

The first tool presented in this toolkit is the case study interview, which is to be conducted with one young person at a time to understand their individual experience of engaging with a youth work organisation, and the impact youth work has had on them. 

As a first step, you will need to identify whose story you or your team want to explore. While it is completely up to your team to decide who to invite to participate, there are several questions you can ask yourself in this process:

- Do we have a relatively honest and trusting relationship with this young person? Alternatively, do we feel that the format of the 1:1 interview could allow this young person to open up and build this relationship?
- How long has this young person been involved with our organisation? For case studies, it might be more beneficial to speak to those who have been with the organisation for a longer time to allow them to explore the long-term impact of youth work.
- From our observations, has this person gone through any sort of small and big changes since their first attendance of our organisation? If yes, an interview might be a good opportunity to explore how those changes came to being (e.g. what was the contribution of youth work) and what is the meaning of those changes to the young person.
- Finally, is this young person likely to only share positive experiences and/or what they expect the youth workers to hear? If so, the young person might need some preparation or additional encouragement to also share what was not so easy or great in their experience of youth work (this also relates to the point around trusting relationships).

Below are the specific outcomes and indicators that this interview script was designed to explore:

*Note: This conversation should be followed up by the youth worker presenting some options of where the young person can find support for their wellbeing, mental and emotional health (in or beyond your organisation), and might potentially require additional signposting.* 

If you can identify a way to include other indicators, please do so. Have a look through the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework here and adapt questions below.

**Introduction**

This semi-structured interview script is an example of how to explore the impact of youth work on a young person’s wellbeing and confidence. As this is an individual interview, the exact phrasing of questions might depend on the specific young person you are speaking to; you might also skip or add questions as you see needed during the interview. 

**What you need**

**Time:** Approximately 40-60 minutes for the interview 

**Space:** A space within your youth centre where the young person can feel safe sharing their thoughts; it shouldn’t be a space where there are many distractions or the young person can easily be overheard

**Materials:** While no specific materials are needed, it is advised that the youth worker takes some notes during the interview; you can also have some paper and pens nearby in case the young person prefers to draw or scribble while speaking.

**Recommended process** 

**Part 1 - Preparation**

Once you have selected one or a few young people you would like to speak to, we suggest speaking to them and asking if they would like to take part. Explain what the conversation will be about, why you are interested to hear from them, stressing that this is totally voluntary, they have the right to skip any or all questions and how you will use what you learn from them (e.g., ‘I will take notes during our chat, and then share a summary of what I have learned with the rest of the team so we can learn from your experience with us and make our organisation work better’). Follow the consent processes provided by QLIP or your organisation to ensure you get informed consent from the young person. Let them know that you’ll be sharing notes with us, but that we won’t use their name or anything that could identify them in anything published.

At the agreed time, reiterate what this conversation will be about and what rights they have. The young person has the right to change their mind at any point and/or not answer any of the questions, if they don’t feel comfortable sharing. 

` `**Part 2 – Suggested interview script**

The script below offers an example of how to lead an interview with a young person, however, based on each individual young person and the flow of the conversation, you might want to adapt, skip or add questions, including any prompts or examples to help them think of the answers. For example, if your organisation primarily does one-to-one work or mentoring, you could adapt the questions to focus on how they found out about your programme and how they experienced their first session(s). You may also want to offer the young person to draw their answers and then speak about them. 

Opening questions (10-15 mins)

1. When did you first come to this youth centre? How did you find out about it?
1. Do you remember your first day/afternoon here? What do you remember about it?
1. Do you like this youth centre now? What do you like about it? What do you not like about it?
1. When you think about yourself back then and now, do you think you have changed in any way? For example, have you learned any new skills, have you taken up any new hobbies, made any new friends? 

Questions on confidence and goals (10 mins)

1. How confident do you feel in yourself, your skills and abilities? What helps you feel more confident?
1. Do you have any short-term or long-term goals? If yes, can you share some of them with me?
1. Are you currently working towards your goals, and if yes, how? Do you feel you will be successful in achieving them?
1. What is something that you have done (here or outside the youth centre) that you feel proud of?

Questions on problem solving and resilience (10 mins)

1. How do you feel and react when you encounter a new problem? How do you approach it?
1. How do you feel when something goes wrong, or you make a mistake? What helps you feel better?

Questions on well-being and sense of safety (10 mins)

1. Overall, how happy are you with your life at this current moment? What makes you happy the most?
1. If you remember yourself a year ago, do you now feel more or less happy? Why?
1. If you needed help, would you talk about your wellbeing at this youth club (e.g. with youth workers)? Why/why not?
1. Do you feel physically safe when spending time at this youth club? Why/why not?

*Note: This conversation should be followed up by youth worker presenting some options of where the young person can find support for their wellbeing, mental and emotional health (in or beyond your organisation), and might potentially require additional signposting.* 

**Part 3 – Reflection**

To understand the impact of youth work on the young person you spoke to, you will need to return to your notes and review them. The questions suggested in the script are open, however, there are several indications that the young person has experienced positive impact as a result of attending your service (for more, see the full QLIP Impact Measurement Framework), for example:

- They reflect on positive changes in their personal lives that have happened since them joining the youth centre
- They attribute certain changes to the youth centre directly, e.g. feeling more confident due to being able to take up new activities at the youth centre; they see activities at the youth centre directly or indirectly contributing to their goals
- They see the youth centre as a source of support, e.g., when faced with a new problem, they feel they can ask youth workers for advice
- They feel emotionally and physically safe at the youth centre (questions 13 and 14)

The interview may also serve as an opportunity to learn about young people’s needs and how can the centre improve its work to align better with them, for example, learning what makes young people feel most proud or where do they seek support when needed. If you want to develop and write a full case study to use for reporting to QLIP or showcasing your work externally, there are numerous tools available to support you in this process, for example:

- [How to write impactful case studies](https://charitydigital.org.uk/topics/topics/how-to-write-impactful-case-studies-10033)

There is also an opportunity, if your capacity allows, to hold such interviews with the same young people over a longer period of time (e.g., once a year) to observe long-term changes and impact on young people.
