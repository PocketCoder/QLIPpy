,Introduction,
,"Within this framework, there is also scope to use creative data collection methods to understand the impact of youth work on young people. There are several benefits to using creative methods: 1) they are more engaging and interactive than traditional data collection tools; 2) they allow young people to 'talk' about their experiences in a variety of ways, which can feel more inclusive for those who are less capable or less confident in expressing themselves verbally; 3) these methods can easily complement other tools presented in this framework, or day-to-day activities in the youth club (for example, an hour-long 1:1 interview might be more difficult to embed than 30-minute drawing exercise with a few young people).",

,Methods,
,"There is a wide variety of creative activities that can be used as methods of evaluation, including:",
,,Taking photographs
,,Drawing or painting
,,Scrapbooking or collages
,,"Asking to choose visual stimuli that reflect their experiences (e.g., Dixit cards, postcards, cut-outs from magazines)"
,,Asking to choose audio stimuli that reflect their experiences
,,Writing

,Examples,
,"1. Youth workers want to understand whether young people have improved their self awareness (Outcome 2.2). There are several ways creative methods can be applied for this, for example, a) young people are asked to think about how they see themselves and what do they think are the 3 biggest strengths (2.2b). Then they are instructed to spend 30 minutes creating a collage / taking pictures with their phones / drawing / writing a poem (ideally, the method used should be the same for all young people but it doesn't have to be). Afterwards, young people share in a group (voluntarily) what they have created and how they see themselves. The youth worker facilitates the discussion (particularly to try to understand whether the youth club has had any impact on getting to know oneself) and takes notes where possible.",
,"2. As part of a group discussion, youth workers want to understand whether young people have increased their confidence (Outcome 3.2). The youth workers prepare a number of visual stimuli (for example, magazine cut-outs) and ask all young people to choose one image that reflects something that they have done that they are proud of (3.2c). Young people are asked to share voluntarily in a group what they have chosen and what it means, as well as talking about whether it was difficult to think of something they are proud of. The youth worker takes notes where possible, at the same time noting the number of young people who seem to feel confident to speak in the group (3.2d).",
,"3. As part of a case study interview, youth workers want to understand whether the youth club has had an impact on young person's connections with others (Outcome 4.1, 4.1a question). The young person is asked to draw themselves in the middle first, then to draw some of the people in their lives (family members, friends, teachers, anyone else) based on how close they feel to them (the closer to themselves in the paper, the closer the connection); they should connect them with arrows which can be of different colours, they can be straight if it's an uncomplicated relationship or jagged if it's a more complicated relationship (e.g. with more conflicts). Then the YP is asked to also include people from the youth club. Once the YP is happy with their drawing, youth worker asks them to tell a little bit (as much as the YP feels comfortable) about those relationships, both within and beyond the youth club. Additionally, they can ask whether these relationships have changed over the last year to see if there have been changes. The youth worker takes notes where possible.",
