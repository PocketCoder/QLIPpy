At QLIP we know that training helps your team deliver the best quality youth work possible. We offer a range of in house courses suitable for paid and voluntary practitioners, including those with management responsibilities. We also recognise that we’re not experts in everything, and we source high quality trainings for Islington based practitioners based on the current needs of the sector.

Supervision has become an established, accepted aspect of many helping professions such as counselling and social work. In youth work, supervision is ‘a fundamental practice need for all workers at all levels’. Find out more about supervision and register you interest.

QLIP supports the youth sector in Islington to better measure, understand and communicate the impact that their work has on young people. We’ve developed a bespoke impact measurement framework, as well as a series of interactive measurement tools, specifically for Islington organisations.

We’re passionate about youth work, and we know that youth workers and organisations are unique (just like young people). That’s we offer bespoke advice, and support from safeguarding, health & safety and mental health, to equality & diversity, business planning, impact measurement and leadership.
