Title: Youth Work in Islington: Impact Report 2023/24 – QLIP

We’re delighted to share the second impact report on youth work in Islington!

This report, published by Young Islington’s Quality and Impact Steering Group and produced by the Quality, Leadership and Impact Partnership (QLIP), explores the impact of youth work on young people with a particular focus on young people transitioning from primary to secondary education. Compiling evidence of practice from across a diverse range of provisions in Islington, this report tells the story of a transformative effect of youth services on the lives of young people and their communities. It showcases a wide range of activities available to young people, and highlights how youth practitioners are supporting young people of all backgrounds and identities to help them reach their full potential and make positive connections that support their development.

This second report revisits key themes including: physical and emotional wellbeing, social, emotional and life skills, improving agency and motivation, and connections to supportive communities. In addition, this report explores how youth work supports young people to navigate this transitional period of their life with confidence and resilience. Youth workers and young people have co-produced the data contributed to this report, and stories and quotes from young people and practitioners are featured throughout the report.
