- What A regular and informal space for Islington youth workers to convene, share best practice, and hear examples of the great work that goes on in the borough. Bring your coffee or lunch and learn something new! 

Sessions are broken up into a short talk by the guest speaker, a chance for questions and group discussion, and time for networking or wider conversations.
- Who These sessions are for anyone who works with young people in Islington. Whether you’re new to that topic, or as equally seasoned as our speaker, we value all perspectives to fuel lively and insightful discussion.
- Why Sharing knowledge is a key pillar of QLIP. We know that each of us holds expertise from our experience and role, and that sharing it can benefit the sector by bringing the best practice and up-to-date knowledge to other organisations.
