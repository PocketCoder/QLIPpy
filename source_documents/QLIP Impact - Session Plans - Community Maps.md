**Impact Measurement**

|**Introduction**|
| :- |
|<p></p><p>QLIP is Islington’s Quality, Leadership and Impact Partnership. We are a joint initiative between London Youth and Mary’s Youth Club, and we’re here to support youth organisations and youth workers to provide the best possible services to young people. </p><p></p><p>We are conducting a project to explore the **impact of youth work** on Islington’s young people, and we need your help! We want to know more about the services you provide, and the effect that your work has on young people in the borough. </p><p></p><p>This is not an evaluation of your organisation, but an opportunity for you to measure and communicate your own impact. You’ll be contributing to an exciting new report, launched this Spring, which will tell the story of Islington’s youth offer and how young people experience it. It’s also an opportunity to reflect on your own impact measurement practice and think about how to strengthen it. </p><p></p>|

**What are these tools?**

To better measure our collective impact, we have developed a new Impact Measurement Framework, which lists key outcome areas and indicators to help us understand the impact of our work. 

We have developed various tools to support youth practitioners to understand their impact on young people. You may have used other tools before, like feedback forms or surveys. These tools are designed to fit better into your existing youth provision, getting young people actively engaged in sharing the impact they have experienced. 

The tools allow you to explore different outcome areas through different methods: 

- a case study interview;
- a survey, followed by a group debrief; and 
- two creative sessions that can be conducted in a group setting.

We hope that these tools will encourage your organisation to explore and understand the impact you have had, and provide you with new evidence around what is working well and what could work even better to align with young people’s needs. 

**Important notes**

- The delivery and reporting of these sessions is completely voluntary, however, by sharing your experiences with QLIP you will contribute to the overall understanding of youth work impact in Islington, as well as help develop better and more accessible impact evaluation processes for other youth organisations.

- You are free to adapt the sessions and/or the questions suggested, as long as they relate to the same outcome area and outcomes. We are very happy to provide one-to-one guidance to help you use these tools – [click here to set up an informal chat](https://calendly.com/hayley-ly/meet) and we can support you to find ways to make the tools work for you and your delivery.
- If you have interest and capacity, you are also welcome to use and adapt the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework according to your organisation’s ways of working and existing impact evaluation processes and create your own sessions and tools.

- The QLIP Impact Measurement Framework has guidance on consent, data privacy, and ethics with regards to these data collection tools and approaches. It is recommended that you review these in detail and develop your own consent and data privacy protocols as well as ethical guidelines which you would like to use to inform any data collection processes. This should be done prior to beginning any data collection activities.

- It is possible that safeguarding concerns may be raised in the course of conducting these activities. Please make sure that whoever is conducting the activity is aware of your organisation’s safeguarding procedures and is ready to support young people who might need it.

**Tool 4 – Community Mapping**

This tool is focused on understanding the perceptions and connections to the community of children and young people but can also be used to explore feelings of safety, environmental wellbeing and ownership of youth work.[^1] 

Below are the specific outcomes and indicators that this tool can be used for:

<table><tr><th colspan="3" valign="top">Focus outcome</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" valign="top">Outcome area</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">Outcome</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">Indicator</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="3"><p>YP have strengthened connections with networks of support and communities</p><p></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="2"><p>Improved connections with communities</p><p></p></td><td colspan="1">YP report feeling connected to the local community</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1">YP report wanting to help or give back to the local community</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1">Improved access to services</td><td colspan="1">YP who take advantage of the referrals and signposting</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3" valign="top">Secondary outcomes</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1">YP have a higher sense of agency and motivation</td><td colspan="1">Sense of ownership within youth work</td><td colspan="1">YP report they feel involved in shaping youth work</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1">YP have better physical and emotional well-being</td><td colspan="1"><p>Improved sense of safety</p><p></p></td><td colspan="1">YP report feeling supported to explore and understand the things that keep them safe​</td></tr>

If you can identify a way to include other indicators, please do so. Have a look through the MEL Framework here and adjust the facilitation questions below.

**Introduction**

This tool is a creative tool to engage with children and young people about how they feel about their community, the services available to them, where they feel safe and how this affects their wellbeing. It is also used to provide a basis for talking with young people about what is being done, what can be done and what will be done in their community to help support their wellbeing.

This can be done with groups, or as a solo activity. It can be done with drawing or using other techniques including painting or even cut up magazines. 

**What you need**

**Time:** Approximately 1.5 hrs including discussion and note taking 

**Materials**: large sheets of flipchart paper, small cards or sticky notes for ‘future’ pictures, magazines, tape, coloured pens or crayons and a notebook for recording discussions 

**Product:** A drawing or map which represents the community as it is now and a set of pictures stuck onto the first drawing or map of the community, showing how children and young people would like the community to be different.

**Recommended process** 

**Part 1 - Preparation**

At the start of the session, you should inform the young people about the purpose of the activity. You should inform the young people in advance that the session will consist of them speaking about their community and their feelings of safety. They also should be aware that if they do not feel comfortable sharing with their peers, they do not have to. Stress that participation is totally voluntary and they have the right to skip any or all questions. Finally, follow the consent processes provided by QLIP or your organisation to ensure you get informed consent from the young person.

**Part 2 – Drawing the ‘present day’ map** 

1. Ask the young people to draw a map of their community. Explain to them they should draw a picture of where things are in their community.
1. Don’t dictate what they should draw, but, if necessary, give them general guidance to encourage them to include the following: 
   1. things or places that are important in their life and their families’ lives 
   1. things or places where they like to spend time, especially socially 
   1. things or places that are dangerous, worrying or they don’t like 
   1. things or places that are especially important for vulnerable young people, including where they live.
1. Take a photo of the map for record keeping or keep the map and post it in a place where the young people can see it.













1. ![](Aspose.Words.3c44aace-6b57-4cb1-a2c8-de7b14f20e03.002.png)Ask questions based on the facilitation questions below and record their answers.

**Part 3 – Drawing the ‘future’ picture** 

1. Ask the young people “What would you like to change in your community to make it better?” and “What is planned or is already changing in your community to make it better?” 
1. Ask young people to draw these changes on the small cards and stick them onto the relevant places on the map. 
1. Remind them to include changes that would particularly help the most vulnerable young people. 
1. Take a photo of the map for record keeping or keep the map and post it in a place where the young people can see it.

**General**

- The photos taken during this process can be used as a project baseline. During evaluation cycles, ask young people to repeat the activities in this tool to see how things have changed in their community, and how their ideas and attitudes about what is important to them have changed. Besides giving useful and interesting data, it shows the young people that they have been listened to and their views have been valued. 
- This tool can also be used to explore what young people view as assets in their community. ‘Assets’ can be defined as the positive experiences, attitudes, relationships, values, skills, and qualities found in young people, peers, families, schools, and communities. Using facilitation questions, ask young people about the ‘assets’ in their community and they can add these to their maps.
