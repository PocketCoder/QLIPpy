        "Title": "What are these tools?\nTo better measure our collective impact, we have developed a new Impact Measurement Framework, which lists key outcome areas and indicators to help us understand the impact of our work. \nWe have developed various tools to support youth practitioners to understand their impact on young people. You may have used other tools before, like feedback forms or surveys. These tools are designed to fit better into your existing youth provision, getting young people actively engaged in sharing the impact they have experienced. \nThe tools allow you to explore different outcome areas through different methods: \na case study interview;\na survey, followed by a group debrief; and \ntwo creative sessions that can be conducted in a group setting.\nWe hope that these tools will encourage your organisation to explore and understand the impact you have had, and provide you with new evidence around what is working well and what could work even better to align with young people\u2019s needs. \n\nImportant notes\nThe delivery and reporting of these sessions is completely voluntary, however, by sharing your experiences with QLIP you will contribute to the overall understanding of youth work impact in Islington, as well as help develop better and more accessible impact evaluation processes for other youth organisations.\n\nYou are free to adapt the sessions and/or the questions suggested, as long as they relate to the same outcome area and outcomes. We are very happy to provide one-to-one guidance to help you use these tools \u2013 click here to set up an informal chat and we can support you to find ways to make the tools work for you and your delivery.\n\nIf you have interest and capacity, you are also welcome to use and adapt the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework according to your organisation\u2019s ways of working and existing impact evaluation processes and create your own sessions and tools.\n\nThe QLIP Impact Measurement Framework has guidance on consent, data privacy, and ethics with regards to these data collection tools and approaches. It is recommended that you review these in detail and develop your own consent and data privacy protocols as well as ethical guidelines which you would like to use to inform any data collection processes. This should be done prior to beginning any data collection activities.\n\nIt is possible that safeguarding concerns may be raised in the course of conducting these activities. Please make sure that whoever is conducting the activity is aware of your organisation\u2019s safeguarding procedures and is ready to support young people who might need it.",

        "Title": "Case study interview (1:1)\n\nThe first tool presented in this toolkit is the case study interview, which is to be conducted with one young person at a time to understand their individual experience of engaging with a youth work organisation, and the impact youth work has had on them. \nAs a first step, you will need to identify whose story you or your team want to explore. While it is completely up to your team to decide who to invite to participate, there are several questions you can ask yourself in this process:\nDo we have a relatively honest and trusting relationship with this young person? Alternatively, do we feel that the format of the 1:1 interview could allow this young person to open up and build this relationship?\nHow long has this young person been involved with our organisation? For case studies, it might be more beneficial to speak to those who have been with the organisation for a longer time to allow them to explore the long-term impact of youth work.\nFrom our observations, has this person gone through any sort of small and big changes since their first attendance of our organisation? If yes, an interview might be a good opportunity to explore how those changes came to being (e.g. what was the contribution of youth work) and what is the meaning of those changes to the young person.\nFinally, is this young person likely to only share positive experiences and/or what they expect the youth workers to hear? If so, the young person might need some preparation or additional encouragement to also share what was not so easy or great in their experience of youth work (this also relates to the point around trusting relationships).\nBelow are the specific outcomes and indicators that this interview script was designed to explore:\n\nNote: This conversation should be followed up by the youth worker presenting some options of where the young person can find support for their wellbeing, mental and emotional health (in or beyond your organisation), and might potentially require additional signposting. \nIf you can identify a way to include other indicators, please do so. Have a look through the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework here and adapt questions below.",

        "Title": "This semi-structured interview script is an example of how to explore the impact of youth work on a young person\u2019s wellbeing and confidence. As this is an individual interview, the exact phrasing of questions might depend on the specific young person you are speaking to; you might also skip or add questions as you see needed during the interview. \nWhat you need\nTime: Approximately 40-60 minutes for the interview \nSpace: A space within your youth centre where the young person can feel safe sharing their thoughts; it shouldn\u2019t be a space where there are many distractions or the young person can easily be overheard\nMaterials: While no specific materials are needed, it is advised that the youth worker takes some notes during the interview; you can also have some paper and pens nearby in case the young person prefers to draw or scribble while speaking.\nRecommended process \nPart 1 - Preparation\nOnce you have selected one or a few young people you would like to speak to, we suggest speaking to them and asking if they would like to take part. Explain what the conversation will be about, why you are interested to hear from them, stressing that this is totally voluntary, they have the right to skip any or all questions and how you will use what you learn from them (e.g., \u2018I will take notes during our chat, and then share a summary of what I have learned with the rest of the team so we can learn from your experience with us and make our organisation work better\u2019). Follow the consent processes provided by QLIP or your organisation to ensure you get informed consent from the young person. Let them know that you\u2019ll be sharing notes with us, but that we won\u2019t use their name or anything that could identify them in anything published.\nAt the agreed time, reiterate what this conversation will be about and what rights they have. The young person has the right to change their mind at any point and/or not answer any of the questions, if they don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing. \n Part 2 \u2013 Suggested interview script\nThe script below offers an example of how to lead an interview with a young person, however, based on each individual young person and the flow of the conversation, you might want to adapt, skip or add questions, including any prompts or examples to help them think of the answers. For example, if your organisation primarily does one-to-one work or mentoring, you could adapt the questions to focus on how they found out about your programme and how they experienced their first session(s). You may also want to offer the young person to draw their answers and then speak about them. \nOpening questions (10-15 mins)\nWhen did you first come to this youth centre? How did you find out about it?\nDo you remember your first day/afternoon here? What do you remember about it?\nDo you like this youth centre now? What do you like about it? What do you not like about it?\nWhen you think about yourself back then and now, do you think you have changed in any way? For example, have you learned any new skills, have you taken up any new hobbies, made any new friends? \nQuestions on confidence and goals (10 mins)\nHow confident do you feel in yourself, your skills and abilities? What helps you feel more confident?\nDo you have any short-term or long-term goals? If yes, can you share some of them with me?\nAre you currently working towards your goals, and if yes, how? Do you feel you will be successful in achieving them?\nWhat is something that you have done (here or outside the youth centre) that you feel proud of?\nQuestions on problem solving and resilience (10 mins)\nHow do you feel and react when you encounter a new problem? How do you approach it?\nHow do you feel when something goes wrong, or you make a mistake? What helps you feel better?\nQuestions on well-being and sense of safety (10 mins)\nOverall, how happy are you with your life at this current moment? What makes you happy the most?\nIf you remember yourself a year ago, do you now feel more or less happy? Why?\nIf you needed help, would you talk about your wellbeing at this youth club (e.g. with youth workers)? Why/why not?\nDo you feel physically safe when spending time at this youth club? Why/why not?\nNote: This conversation should be followed up by youth worker presenting some options of where the young person can find support for their wellbeing, mental and emotional health (in or beyond your organisation), and might potentially require additional signposting. \nPart 3 \u2013 Reflection\nTo understand the impact of youth work on the young person you spoke to, you will need to return to your notes and review them. The questions suggested in the script are open, however, there are several indications that the young person has experienced positive impact as a result of attending your service (for more, see the full QLIP Impact Measurement Framework), for example:\nThey reflect on positive changes in their personal lives that have happened since them joining the youth centre\nThey attribute certain changes to the youth centre directly, e.g. feeling more confident due to being able to take up new activities at the youth centre; they see activities at the youth centre directly or indirectly contributing to their goals\nThey see the youth centre as a source of support, e.g., when faced with a new problem, they feel they can ask youth workers for advice\nThey feel emotionally and physically safe at the youth centre (questions 13 and 14)\nThe interview may also serve as an opportunity to learn about young people\u2019s needs and how can the centre improve its work to align better with them, for example, learning what makes young people feel most proud or where do they seek support when needed. If you want to develop and write a full case study to use for reporting to QLIP or showcasing your work externally, there are numerous tools available to support you in this process, for example:\nHow to write a case study that wins hearts and minds\nWriting engaging charity case studies\nHow to write impactful case studies\nThere is also an opportunity, if your capacity allows, to hold such interviews with the same young people over a longer period of time (e.g., once a year) to observe long-term changes and impact on young people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- FILE: QLIP-MEL-Framework-v3-Feb23.pdf ---",

Each indicator has its corresponding data \ncollection approaches, including sources, tools, questions, and answer types (B . MEL Framework \ntab). There are five different types of data collection approaches for each indicator: case study \ninterview, survey, group discussion, creative and observation.

(e.g., will \nyoung people feel comfortable sharing this information with their peers?) ?\nDoes the answer to the question potentially require a follow-up from the \nyouth workers? (e.g., questions on emotional wellbeing, sense of safety) \nThese questions should not be included in an anonymous survey ?\n?\nWe will be discussing this with providers over the next month to find out how the best way for this to happen is and what we \ncan ask of you as youth work providers.Outcome areaThe framework provides advice on the questions and frequency of data collection so using the framework and the outcomes, \nindicators and data collection tools selected, you can extract the relevant questions to create your bespoke tools e.g. paste \neach of the group discussion questions you have selected into a group discussion guide.\nYou should also include the relevant  introduction and consent protocols  to the tools before you start using them.

At this stage avoid biasing the case study by selecting only the outcomes that you think \nthe young person will have something positive to say on.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decide on the format of the case study. It could be a video, an audio file or a written case \nstudy. This will dictate how you record the interview.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Find a safe space to conduct the interview and introduce the process to the young person, \nensure they understand what will be happening, how the final product will be used and what is \nexpected of them.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Edit the content of the case study to tell the story you are want to tell. This can include \nstructuring it according to outcomes or telling the story of the journey of the young person. \nDelivering a survey\nIn order to design and deliver a survey you should consider the following steps:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once you have designed the survey using the questions in your framework, decide who you will \nbe issuing the survey too. This may depend on the age groups or when the young people started \nattending the centre or a specific demographic group you have identified as wanting more information \non. Depending on whether you will be conducting these surveys as baseline, midline or endline it may \nbe important to consider what additional information you might need as part of this.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decide how you will issue the survey e.g. emailing to young people, asking them to fill in when \nthey arrive at the centre or issuing paper copies as part of an activity. This will dictate what tech you \nwill need, what format you need to have the survey in and how long the data collection period will be. \nThere are a lot of free survey softwares you can use including Google Forms and Survey Monkey.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once you have issued the survey and collected all the data you will need to collate all the \nresponses and conduct data analysis. This will help you identify trends and anomalies within the data \nand build a better picture of where the young people you are working with are.\nDelivering a group discussion\nIn order to design and deliver a group discussion you should consider the following steps:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decide what you want to discuss in the group discussion\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ensure the young people has the opportunity to ask any questions about the process.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once you have conducted the discussion you will need to conduct data analysis. This will help you \nidentify trends and anomalies within the data and build a better picture of where the young people you are \nworking with are.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Select the young people that you want to include in the group discussion. Consider ages, genders \nand personalities within the group. You may want to keep it small to allow each child to feel safe and \nheard, this could be three young people.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Select the questions you want to ask the group. At this stage be realistic about what they might feel \ncomfortable answering in a group setting and how many questions will be appropriate to ask to ensure it \ndoesn\u2019t go on for too long.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decide how you will record the case study, either by taking notes or recording it on audio or video \nformat. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Find a safe space to conduct the group discussion and introduce the process to the young people, \nensure they understand what will be happening, how the final product will be used and what is expected of \nthem.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conduct the group discussion with the young people ensuring they feel comfortable at all stages.",

        "Content": "ExamplesWithin this framework, there is also scope to use creative data collection methods to understand the impact of youth work on young people. There are several \nbenefits to using creative methods: 1) they are more engaging and interactive than traditional data collection tools; 2) they allow young people to 'talk' about their \nexperiences in a variety of ways, which can feel more inclusive for those who are less capable or less confident in expressing themselves verbally; 3) these \nmethods can easily complement other tools presented in this framework, or day-to-day activities in the youth club (for example, an hour-long 1:1 interview might \nbe more difficult to embed than 30-minute drawing exercise with a few young people).\n1. Youth workers want to understand whether young people have improved their self awareness (Outcome 2.2). There are several ways creative methods can \nbe applied for this, for example, a) young people are asked to think about how they see themselves and what do they think are the 3 biggest strengths (2.2b). \nThen they are instructed to spend 30 minutes creating a collage / taking pictures with their phones / drawing / writing a poem (ideally, the method used should \nbe the same for all young people but it doesn't have to be). Afterwards, young people share in a group (voluntarily) what they have created and how they see \nthemselves. The youth worker facilitates the discussion (particularly to try to understand whether the youth club has had any impact on getting to know oneself) \nand takes notes where possible.\n2. As part of a group discussion, youth workers want to understand whether young people have increased their confidence (Outcome 3.2). The youth workers \nprepare a number of visual stimuli (for example, magazine cut-outs) and ask all young people to choose one image that reflects something that they have done \nthat they are proud of (3.2c). Young people are asked to share voluntarily in a group what they have chosen and what it means, as well as talking about whether \nit was difficult to think of something they are proud of. The youth worker takes notes where possible, at the same time noting the number of young people who \nseem to feel confident to speak in the group (3.2d).\n3. As part of a case study interview, youth workers want to understand whether the youth club has had an impact on young person's connections with others \n(Outcome 4.1, 4.1a question). The young person is asked to draw themselves in the middle first, then to draw some of the people in their lives (family members, \nfriends, teachers, anyone else) based on how close they feel to them (the closer to themselves in the paper, the closer the connection); they should connect \nthem with arrows which can be of different colours, they can be straight if it's an uncomplicated relationship or jagged if it's a more complicated relationship (e.g. \nwith more conflicts). Then the YP is asked to also include people from the youth club. Once the YP is happy with their drawing, youth worker asks them to tell a \nlittle bit (as much as the YP feels comfortable) about those relationships, both within and beyond the youth club. Additionally, they can ask whether these \nrelationships have changed over the last year to see if there have been changes. The youth worker takes notes where possible."

        "Content": "ExamplesFinally, for certain outcomes, youth workers can also keep a log over a period of time (e.g. 6 months) to track certain indicators that can be reviewed once in a \nwhile. For this method, it is important to decide on the indicators in advance, as it might be more difficult to get accurate data retroactively. Observation is useful \nas an additional data point, particularly to compare data collected directly from young people vs. what the youth workers have observed or learned about over a \nperiod of time. If observation is applied over a few learning 'cycles' (e.g. 2 years), then it will also help observe any changes or tendencies that need addressing.\n1. If the youth club already monitors young people's attendance in various activities, some of the indicators can easily be tracked without additional effort from \nthe youth workers. These indicators include 1.1c ' Number of YP taking part in sport activities in YO in the last 6/9/12 months ', 2.1b ' Number of YP attending skill-\nbased workshops or activities within YO in the last 6/9/12 months ', 4.3a ' Number of signposting/referral cases to other services in the community in the last \n6/9/12 months ', and potentially others depending on the youth club's practices. \n2. Some of the suggested indicators might require additional tracking, as to understand the impact, it is also useful to note more informal interactions between \nyoung people and the youth club or the youth workers. These indicators include 1.2b ' Number of 1:1 conversations with YP around their well-being in the last \n6/9/12 months ', 3.1b ' Number of YP who take responsibilities within the youth club over the last 6/9/12 months ' or 3.3b ' Number of YP who took up new \nopportunities in the last 6/9/12months '. \n3. There are also some indicators that are based on youth workers' subjective perception and are more qualitative methods of observation, requiring youth \nworkers to note some examples or specific cases of young people achieving this outcome. For example, 3.2d ' Percentage of YP who speak up and share their \nopinions in a group ' or 4.1h ' YP are able to solve conflicts within YO (with or without YW help) '.\nAdditionally, all data collected (with any data collection tool) should always be critically reviewed by youth workers, as they often have the best \ninsight whether young people are sharing their experiences openly and honestly, or are they experiencing any barriers that might influence their \nanswers (e.g., wanting to please the youth workers or feeling peer pressure).\nPart 1 (Impact)\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\nPart 2 (General)\n2.1What are some of the key lessons for the individual youth workers and organisation as a whole from the last six months?\n2.2How can we embed these learnings into our practice in the next six months?\n2.3Where do we still have gaps, questions and concerns regarding our work? What do we want to achieve in the next six months?\n2.4To what extent are we connecting and collaborating with other YOs? How have (or can) these partnerships improve our offer to YP?\n2.5To what extent are young people influencing our activities and work in the organisation? How can we ensure they feel ownership over youth work?\nFollowing these sessions, we suggest writing a summary of the Part 1 of the conversation that can be shared with QLIP. This will help us understand \nwhat impact is achieved throughout Islington across youth organisations, what are the most common challenges and how can QLIP best support youth \norganisations. It will also help us continuously revise and reflect on the MEL framework and suggested data collection processes.We suggest a following structure for these sessions (which can be adapted to your team's needs and ways of working):As part of using this MEL framework to understand your impact, we also suggest embedding regular learning and reflection spaces within your \norganisations. These spaces can be designed according to the ways of working with your team, and it is up to you and your team how they will be \ndelivered and who will lead them. We suggest deciding on the length of these learning cycles in advance and holding space for them every 6, 9 or 12 \nmonths (or another timeline that makes sense for your organisation; in this example, we use 6 months ).\nPrior to the learning and reflection session, the team should collate all impact data collected in the last 6 months and bring it to the meeting so it can be \ndiscussed as a group. \nReviewing the impact on young people  in the last 6 months : team member(s) share the data they have collected based on the agreed outcomes and \ndiscuss whether the data reflects their personal views of the young people. Is there anything that 'doesn't sound right?' Is there any impact areas that have \nbeen observed but are not reflected in the data presented?\nIdentifying and discussing areas of impact that could be strengthened in the next 6 months . What specific steps can the team take to ensure we achieve \nwhat we want to achieve? What barriers do we face currently and can we address those? Do we need any external support or expertise?\nDiscussing data collection processes within the organisation. Have the young people been willing to open up about themselves? Does the team see value \nin understanding the impact better? Which data collection tools did not work or worked particularly well? What other challenges around data collection do \nwe face currently and how can we address those?\nInformed Consent*\n* Adapted from the NSPCC Learning: Research with children: ethics, safety and promoting inclusionWithin this it is important to discuss who the data will be shared with. This should be both who within the organisation will have \naccess to the data (e.g. just the youth work team or the whole organisation), what data they will be able to see (e.g. identifiable, \nanonymised or analysed data) and those external to the organisation. This will include discussing that the data in an anonymised \nformat will be shared with QLIP and the process by which it will be shared. Please see Tab L for more information on this.QLIP feels it is crucial that young people consent to any data collection in an informed, voluntary and ethical way. Below is some \nsuggestions for ways to do this but we encourage all organisations to do their own research and develop their own consent \nprocesses. \nWhen you ask for permission for children to be involved in any data collection activities, ensure that children and their parents or \ncarers (if needed) fully understand:\n- what the activity is about\n- how the data will be recorded (e.g. video recordings etc)\n- how the data will be stored (e.g. in a password protected excel or on a CRM) and shared (e.g. via a secure server or over email)\n- what the data will and wont be used for\n- what is expected of participants\n- what the risks and benefits of participating in the activity are\n- that participating is voluntary.\nThis is known as informed consent.\nIf a child doesn\u2019t consent or assent to participate in data collection activity, this overrides the consent from the parent, guardian, \ncarer, or other appropriate adult with a duty of care.Make sure you consider children\u2019s capacity to consent to involvement in the activity. This will depend on their level of understanding \nof the potential risks and benefits of taking part.\nWhen considering whether a child is mature enough to make decisions about things that directly affect them, professionals often \ntalk about whether the child is \u2018Gillick competent\u2019. Gillick competency means a young person is mature enough to fully understand \nwhat they are agreeing to.\nRead more about Gillick competency here. \nIf a child isn\u2019t fully able to understand the consequences of taking part, but is able to express willingness to participate and \nunderstand what is expected of them, it may be appropriate to seek their \u2018assent\u2019. In such cases consent should always be sought \nfrom their parent or carer.\nConsent should also be obtained from the parent, carer or other appropriate adult for all children under the age of 8, and in most \ncases for children aged 8-15. For young people aged 16 and 17, you should carefully consider whether parental consent is \nappropriate. If you don\u2019t seek parental consent, you should justify your approach and consider whether parents should be informed \nof the activity.\nIt is crucial you have a data privacy statement that all those you are collecting evidence from have a chance to read. This will \nexplain how the data will be stored and who it will be shared with. This is an example from Mary\u2019s Youth Services.It must be made clear that there are no negative consequences to refusing to take part in the activity and that children or their \nparent or carer can also withdraw consent at any time. You should regularly check with young people and their families during the \nprocess that they are still happy to take part.\nYou should have a formal record that consent has been given before the activity starts. Using a consent form enables children to \nconfirm they understand what the activity will involve and are happy to take part. You should include all of the above information in \nthe consent form and make sure the young people have a copy of this for themselves. It should also include a summary of the data \nprivacy policy (see below) and clear instructions where they can access more information on this.\nYou should keep all participants\u2019 personal information confidential and comply with the Data Protection Act 2018."

You may have used other tools before, like feedback forms or surveys. These tools are designed to fit better into your existing youth provision, getting young people actively engaged in sharing the impact they have experienced. \nThe tools allow you to explore different outcome areas through different methods: \na case study interview;\na survey, followed by a group debrief; and \ntwo creative sessions that can be conducted in a group setting.\nWe hope that these tools will encourage your organisation to explore and understand the impact you have had, and provide you with new evidence around what is working well and what could work even better to align with young people\u2019s needs. \n\nImportant notes\nThe delivery and reporting of these sessions is completely voluntary, however, by sharing your experiences with QLIP you will contribute to the overall understanding of youth work impact in Islington, as well as help develop better and more accessible impact evaluation processes for other youth organisations.\n\nYou are free to adapt the sessions and/or the questions suggested, as long as they relate to the same outcome area and outcomes. We are very happy to provide one-to-one guidance to help you use these tools \u2013 click here to set up an informal chat and we can support you to find ways to make the tools work for you and your delivery.\n\nIf you have interest and capacity, you are also welcome to use and adapt the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework according to your organisation\u2019s ways of working and existing impact evaluation processes and create your own sessions and tools.\n\nThe QLIP Impact Measurement Framework has guidance on consent, data privacy, and ethics with regards to these data collection tools and approaches. It is recommended that you review these in detail and develop your own consent and data privacy protocols as well as ethical guidelines which you would like to use to inform any data collection processes. This should be done prior to beginning any data collection activities.\n\nIt is possible that safeguarding concerns may be raised in the course of conducting these activities.

Similarly to other tools, you are free to adapt the activity and the group discussion. \nWhat you need\nTime: You have several different options to deliver this session:\nYou can give young people a distinct period of time (for example, one hour) to take photographs based on the prompts provided, followed by a group discussion on the same day\nAlternatively, you can ask young people to take photographs over a longer period (e.g., one week) and come back to discuss them as a group on an agreed day\nMaterials: To allow all young people to take photographs, you should consider whether they have and are able to use their phones as cameras. If some young people do not have personal phones or are unable to use them for this purpose, you might want to consider allowing to use phones belonging to the youth centre (under supervision and in line with your e-safety or tech policies); young people can also complete the exercise in pairs sharing one phone (with the consent of those whose phones are being used). \nAs another alternative, you may decide to deliver this session using drawings/paintings or another type of creative medium instead of photographs.\nRecommended process \nPart 1 \u2013 Preparation\nAt the start of the session, you should inform the young people about the purpose of the activity. You should inform the young people in advance that the session will consist of (1) them taking photographs based on different prompts and (2) sharing their photographs with the peer group and discussing them. They also should be aware that if they do not feel comfortable sharing their photographs with others, they will not have to do that. Stress that participation is totally voluntary and they have the right to skip any or all questions. Finally, follow the consent processes provided by QLIP or your organisation to ensure you get informed consent from the young person.\nPart 2 \u2013 Photo activity\nFor the photo activity, invite young people to take three photographs based on these prompts:\nMy experience at this youth centre\nSomething I am proud of\nMy future goal, ambition or dream\nAfter providing them with the prompts, invite them to ask questions and clarify the prompts if they feel they are not clear enough. Where possible, leave room for their own interpretation (especially if you are working with older groups of children and young people), however, if they are struggling with the task, provide them with a space to discuss ideas for their photographs before actually taking them. \nPart 3 \u2013 Discussion in a group\nFor the second part of this session, we suggest bringing the group of young people back together to share their pictures with each other and discuss what has been photographed (ideally, you would be able to show the pictures taken on a projector so everybody can see them at the same time, however, that is not essential). As an additional suggestion, you can invite young people to think of captions for their three pictures.\nAlthough there are different ways to facilitate the group conversation and based on each group different methods might work best, we suggest this structure:\nFor each of the pictures taken, show the picture to the group so everybody can take a look. It might be best to go through the pictures by themes (e.g., looking at everyone\u2019s \u2018experience at the youth centre\u2019, followed by \u2018something I am proud of\u2019, etc.); you may also ask young people to select one picture each they want to show to the group (particularly if the group is more than 4-5 people).\nAsk the group: What do you think is pictured here? What does this picture make you feel? What questions do you have for the author of this picture? You can be flexible in how to lead this question, however, allow the young people to associate freely. Ensure young people are respectful of each other\u2019s photographs and opinions.\nAsk the author: How do you feel listening to the group? What was your original idea for this picture? \nThe initial discussion about the pictures should encourage young people to think and reflect about theirs and their peers\u2019 experiences at the youth centre, their confidence in themselves and their future goals. For each of the themes explored, we also suggest additional general follow-up questions that can be posed to the group:\nMy experience at this youth centre\nWhat has been your favourite memory in this youth centre?\nWhat could make your experience here better? \nDo you feel that youth workers listen to young people\u2019s opinions here? Why or why not?\nDo you feel like you are involved in shaping the centre\u2019s activities and day-to-day life? Why or why not? \nSomething I am proud of\nWhat or who helped you achieve this and how?\nHow confident do you feel in yourself? What helps you feel more confident?\nHow do you feel about trying new things (for example, new activities offered at your youth club)? What helps you to try new things?\nHave you tried any new things (for example, new activities offered at your youth club, new hobbies or learning opportunities) in the last year? If so, what were they?\nMy future goal, ambition or dream\nWhat are some other goals that you have (short- or long-term)? \nAre you working towards them, and if so, how? Do you feel you will be successful in achieving them?\nAs with other activities, the facilitator should be recording the answers and making notes, particularly about young people\u2019s reflections of how the youth centre and youth workers contributed to their confidence, sense of ownership and goal setting. \n\n\n\n--- FILE: QLIP Website Links.docx ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- FILE: QLIP_Program_Details.docx ---\n\nWelcome to QLIP: Quality, Leadership, Impact, and Partnership\nIn collaboration with London Youth and Mary\u2019s Youth Club, QLIP is committed to offering comprehensive support to youth organisations and practitioners across the borough.

These tools are designed to fit better into your existing youth provision, getting young people actively engaged in sharing the impact they have experienced. \nThe tools allow you to explore different outcome areas through different methods: \na case study interview;\na survey, followed by a group debrief; and \ntwo creative sessions that can be conducted in a group setting.\nWe hope that these tools will encourage your organisation to explore and understand the impact you have had, and provide you with new evidence around what is working well and what could work even better to align with young people\u2019s needs. \n\nImportant notes\nThe delivery and reporting of these sessions is completely voluntary, however, by sharing your experiences with QLIP you will contribute to the overall understanding of youth work impact in Islington, as well as help develop better and more accessible impact evaluation processes for other youth organisations.\n\nYou are free to adapt the sessions and/or the questions suggested, as long as they relate to the same outcome area and outcomes. We are very happy to provide one-to-one guidance to help you use these tools \u2013 click here to set up an informal chat and we can support you to find ways to make the tools work for you and your delivery.\n\nIf you have interest and capacity, you are also welcome to use and adapt the QLIP Impact Measurement Framework according to your organisation\u2019s ways of working and existing impact evaluation processes and create your own sessions and tools.\n\nThe QLIP Impact Measurement Framework has guidance on consent, data privacy, and ethics with regards to these data collection tools and approaches. It is recommended that you review these in detail and develop your own consent and data privacy protocols as well as ethical guidelines which you would like to use to inform any data collection processes. This should be done prior to beginning any data collection activities.\n\nIt is possible that safeguarding concerns may be raised in the course of conducting these activities.

Similarly to other tools, you are free to adapt, add or skip questions both for the survey and the group discussion. \nWhat you need\nTime: Approximately 45 minutes for the session (15 mins for the survey + 30 minutes for the discussion in the group)\nMaterials: Depending on your preferred ways of working, you may decide to conduct the survey online (e.g. young people fill out the survey using their phones or computers at your youth centre) or give out paper-based surveys. You could also ask young people to respond in a more physical way (e.g. going to certain parts of the room) but be aware that this might cause young people to respond differently as the answers are no longer private.\nRecommended process \nPart 1 \u2013 Preparation\nBefore the session, we suggest preparing and inviting young people ahead of time: explain what the session will look like, what kind of questions will be asked, why you are interested to hear from them. Stress that participation is totally voluntary and they have the right to skip any or all questions. Finally, follow the consent processes provided by QLIP or your organisation to ensure you get informed consent from the young person.\nAt the start of the session, reiterate what the survey and the group discussion will be about and the rights that they have. The young people have the right to change their mind at any point and/or not answer any of the questions, if they don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing. \nPart 2 \u2013 Suggested survey \nAt the start of the survey, we suggest inserting a short written introduction to the activity, for example:\n\u201cThe first part of today\u2019s session is a short survey, consisting of 10 questions. We would like to hear about the skills and knowledge you have learned at this youth centre, and what else you would like to learn in the future. You can choose to skip any questions that you don\u2019t want to answer. Following this survey, we will also have a conversation as a group. Thank you for agreeing to share your experiences with us!\u201d\nHow long have you been attending this youth centre? \nLess than 6 months\n6 months \u2013 1 year\n1 \u2013 3 years\nMore than 3 years\n\nSince joining, have you learned any of the following skills at this youth centre?\nNote: the answer options here should be adapted based on the priorities of your organisation \u2013 ask about the specific skills you want to see young people develop.\nTeamwork skills\nConflict management skills\nStress management skills"

Before starting the conversation, we also would advise asking young people if they had any questions while completing the survey and what did they think about the survey overall.\nSome of the other questions for the group discussion could include the below. However, we encourage you to adapt them based on your organisation\u2019s model and priorities.\nIn general, do you like to learn new skills or about new things? Why or why not? \nWhat are your favourite ways to learn in the youth centre? \nDo you think youth centres are a good place to learn additional skills and knowledge? Why or why not?\nWhat other skills and knowledge (beyond those you mentioned in the survey) do you think you gained since joining the youth centre?
